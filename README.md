## The assignment is about a build of slope map of D8 algorithm.

## Description of programming content:
This is a model of a construct of the slope map via using the D8 algorithm, iit is implemented via the pycharm software and the associated external plugins, so if people want to run this model, it is best for them to use the application of pycharm, and download the relevant plugins, such as "Anaconda". After run it, the users can get an original map of maximum slope, and decorated map of maximum slope, and a data text of output map. 

## Description of document:
the python document of running has one, it was called "main.py", all the available information can be found in this file,
this file including a function of readdata, a function of writeif, and a main function of D8Algorithm, which is the most important part, is how the maximum slope value is calculated.


## How to run it?
Open the model.py document, run it,  all relevant information will be tested and printed in the console and the relevant maps will be output according to the original map file
